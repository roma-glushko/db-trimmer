# DB-Trimmer

DB-Trimmer is a tool to reduce database size for staging or development environments in an intelligent way.

## PoC

Currently, the tool contains three PoC for trimming databases:

- blocking deleting in chunks
- nonblocking deleting in chunks
- PoC based on recreating database structure and moving only needed dataset (WIP)
